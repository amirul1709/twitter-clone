            Thanos debuted in The Invincible Iron Man #55 (February 1973),
            featuring a story by Jim Starlin that was co-scripted by Mike
            Friedrich. The storyline from that issue continued through Captain
            Marvel #25–33 (bi-monthly: March 1973 – Jan. 1974), Marvel Feature
            #12 (Nov. 1973), Daredevil #107 (Jan. 1974), and Avengers #125 (July

            1976), Marvel Team Up #55 (March 1977), and the 1977 Annuals for

            until the end of Warlock #9). He was also featured in a short backup
            story in Logan's Run #6 (June 1977) and had a small role in the

            and the Infinity Watch #1–42 (Feb. 1992 – Aug. 1995). This was
            followed by crossover appearances in Infinity War #1–6 (June – Nov.
            1992), Infinity Crusade #1–6 (June – Nov. 1993), Silver Surfer vol.

            #1–6 (March – July 1994), and Cosmic Powers Unlimited #1 (May 1995).
            Thanos appeared in a connected storyline in Ka-Zar vol. 2, #4–11
            (Aug. 1997 – March 1998), Ka-Zar Annual (1997), and the X-Man and
            Hulk Annual (1998), before featuring in Thor vol. 2, #21–25 (March –
            July 2000) and the 2000 Annual. The character was next used in
            Captain Marvel vol. 4, #17–19 (June–Aug. 2001), Avengers: Celestial
            Quest #1–8 (Nov. 2001 – June 2002), Infinity Abyss #1–6 (Aug. – Oct.

            received an eponymous title that ran for 12 issues. In 2006, the
            character played an important role in Annihilation: Silver Surfer
            #1–4 (June – Sept. 2006) and Annihilation #1–6 (Oct. 2006 – March
            2007). The character was re-introduced in Guardians of the Galaxy
            vol. 2, #24–25 (April – May 2010) and played a major role in The
            Thanos Imperative: Ignition (June 2010) and The Thanos Imperative
            #1–6 (July – Dec. 2010). The character returned in Avengers Assemble
            #1 (March 2012).[6] A mini-series titled Thanos: Son of Titan by Joe
            Keatinge was planned for publication in August 2012, but was
            cancelled.[7] The character's origin was expanded in the five-issue
            Thanos Rising miniseries by Jason Aaron and Simone Bianchi which was
            published monthly beginning in April 2013.[8] Later that same year,
            Thanos played a central role in the Infinity miniseries written by
            Jonathan Hickman and drawn by Jim Cheung, Jerome Opeña, and Dustin
            Weaver. In May 2014, Jim Starlin and Ron Lim worked together on the
            one-shot Thanos Annual, which is a prelude to a new trilogy of
            original graphic novels. The first, Thanos: The Infinity Revelation,
            was released the following August.[9][10] Beginning in February
            2015, Starlin also penned a four-issue miniseries titled Thanos vs.
            Hulk, which was set prior to the graphic novels. The second
            installment in the trilogy, Thanos: The Infinity Relativity, was
            released in June 2015.[11] The third graphic novel, Thanos: The
            Infinity Finale, as well as the connected mini-series The Infinity
            Entity were published in 2016.[12] At the same time Starlin was
            writing these graphic novels and tie-ins, the character also
            appeared in New Avengers #23–24 (Oct – Nov 2014),[13] Guardians of
            the Galaxy vol. 3, #18–20 (Oct – Dec 2014), Legendary Star-Lord #4
            (Dec 2014), a six-issue miniseries titled Thanos: A God Up There
            Listening (Dec 2014), Avengers vol. 5, #40–41 (Mar – Apr 2015), and
            Deadpool vol. 3, #45 ("#250") (Jun 2015). Thanos also played a major
            role in the five-issue miniseries The Infinity Gauntlet vol. 2,
            (July 2015 – Jan 2016), a tie-in of the cross-over Secret Wars
            (2015). In 2017, as part of Marvel NOW!, Thanos received his own
            solo title written by Jeff Lemire and drawn by Mike Deodato. After
            11 issues, Donny Cates and Geoff Shaw took over as the creative
            team. This storyline crossed over with Donny Cates' Cosmic Ghost
            Rider storyline. In 2021, Thanos was later reintroduced as a primary
            antagonist in the comic series Eternals vol. 5, #1–12, by the writer
            Kieron Gillen and artist Esad Ribić, and plays a prominent role in
            exploring Eternals mythos and retcons.
